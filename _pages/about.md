I am a master's student at Columbia University. Previously I completed my BE(Hons) in Mechatronics Engineering at The University of Auckland, where I worked on robotics at the [New Dexterity](https://newdexterity.org/) research group advised by [Minas Liarokapis](https://minasliarokapis.com/).

My focus is on mechatronics and mechanical design of robots and automation systems.

I grew up in New Zealand since my childhood as a pround Kiwi and [here](/projects/nz/) are some photos of New Zealand and my friends. I had an amazing time working on creative projects with them, including [LightSense](/projects/1_project/).

<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
