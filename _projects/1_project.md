LightSense is a Cyber-Physical Architecture and Interactive Systems XR installation that I contributed to during my time at the [arc/sec Lab](https://www.arc-sec.com/) working with [Uwe Rieger](https://profiles.auckland.ac.nz/u-rieger). Created in collaboration with the [Augmented Human Lab](https://ahlab.org/) and the [Empathic Computing Lab](https://empathiccomputing.org/) at the University of Auckland, this kinetic structure seamlessly combines a lightweight design with 3D holographic animations. I developed the linear mass distribution system that allows the structure to morph its shape dynamically. It features an integrated AI system that actively engages with the audience, facilitating and sustaining interactive conversations. The installation was showcased at art exhibitions in Ars Electronica Festival and EPFL Pavilions!
